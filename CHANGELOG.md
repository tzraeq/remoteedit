# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Added SFTP Jump Hosts in the Webview and Native Sidebar, including validated multi-hop saved-profile chains, Quick Connect support, names-only route summaries, protected backup references, and automatic hidden SSH stream cleanup without local port mappings.
* Added repeatable built-in Node regression tests for Jump graph validation, hop ordering, internal socket chaining, failure stages, cancellation, and resource cleanup.

### Notes

* Jump Hosts are SFTP-only. FTP and FTPS connections remain direct.
* The documented isolated multi-host topology is an external manual verification procedure and was not executed in the development environment for this change.

## [1.8.11] - 2026-07-15

### Improved

* Added sortable column headers to the Disk, Sessions, and Listeners detail tables in Server View, using the existing ascending, descending, and original-order cycle.
* Renamed the Server View sections to `Log Shortcuts` and `Saved Commands` for consistent feature naming.

### Fixed

* Fixed Webview Files view snapshots being invalidated when Sudo Mode is toggled, keeping file-list refresh behavior consistent between Sudo Mode on and off.

## [1.8.10] - 2026-07-13

### Added

* Added a breadcrumb path tree layout for Open Connections, showing clickable parent folder nodes while keeping the current directory focused.

### Improved

* Changed the default Open Connections path layout to the new breadcrumb view for a better balance between the compact layout and the full path tree.
* Updated Remote Edit licensing language for clearer proprietary use and distribution terms.

## [1.8.9] - 2026-07-10

### Added

* Added `remoteedit.sidebar.openConnections.pathView` to choose between the new full path tree Sidebar layout and the compact path layout for Open Connections.

### Improved

* Improved Server View startup by preloading the first dashboard snapshot in background after SSH/SFTP connections are established, while keeping automatic refreshes limited to the focused Server view.
* Improved Server View Sudo Mode handling so dashboard data is refreshed correctly when privilege state changes.

## [1.8.8] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

* Fixed SSH/SFTP Sudo Mode file reads to preserve binary output as raw bytes instead of decoding and re-encoding it as UTF-8, preventing files with embedded or mixed binary content from being altered.
* Fixed FTP/FTPS transfers to explicitly use binary mode after connect and reconnect, avoiding automatic text/ASCII transformations.
* Fixed FTP/FTPS uploads to stream explicit Buffer chunks for binary-safe file writes.
* Preserved Remote Edit transfer and remote write paths as raw bytes without post-transfer text decoding or re-read verification overhead.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-07-08

### Improved

* Improved Webview connection switching so already loaded file lists are restored immediately per connection, including directory listings completed while the connection tab is not focused.
* Improved SFTP directory listing cache handling so Sudo Mode uses a separate cache scope instead of disabling directory caching entirely.

### Fixed

* Fixed Webview file-list context menu so Create New File and Create New Directory are also available from file rows, creating items in the file's parent directory when the list has no empty area.
* Fixed Webview drag-and-drop upload so multi-selected local files from the OS are all collected when VS Code provides incomplete drag item metadata.
* Fixed Webview drag-and-drop list highlighting while Sudo Mode is enabled, keeping the privileged-session red border while showing the blue drop shadow.
* Fixed stale or provisional directory listing states so empty snapshots and out-of-focus listing responses are not incorrectly discarded or treated as valid loaded results.
* Fixed directory listing cache invalidation so normal and sudo directory caches are cleared together after remote write operations.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

* Fixed VS Code Runtime Status warnings for internal Sidebar focus commands.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-07-04

### Added

* Added Windows SSH/SFTP support with PowerShell-backed commands and Windows Server View.

### Fixed

* Fixed SSH/SFTP disconnect cleanup so sessions no longer stay in Disconnecting when the SSH client close does not complete.
* Fixed Webview Remote Path file opening so entering a file path opens the file without leaving the filename in the Remote Path field.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-06-27

### Added

* Added `remoteedit.webview.fileList.permissionsDisplay` to show compact Webview permission displays in symbolic, numeric, or combined format. Numeric permissions are displayed as 4-digit octal values.
* Added 4-digit octal permissions to file and directory properties, Sidebar hover details, and Set Permissions previews when symbolic permissions are available.
* Added drag-and-drop upload for local files and folders from the OS into remote folders using the Webview file list or Sidebar Open Connections tree.
* Added remote file and folder moving within the same Remote Edit connection using Cut/Paste and drag-and-drop in both the Webview and Sidebar.

### Improved

* Improved Sidebar context menus for Windows SSH/SFTP sessions so supported actions remain available while Unix-only actions such as archive creation and permission changes stay hidden.
* Improved Server View routing so Windows SSH/SFTP sessions use a dedicated PowerShell snapshot while Linux/Unix/AIX sessions keep the existing POSIX/AIX dashboard path.
* Improved Server View service and process actions with Windows-specific PowerShell commands for Windows services and processes.
* Improved Remote Search scope browsing to normalize Windows SSH/SFTP paths consistently.

### Changed

* Limited Remote Edit Command Palette entries to Open and Settings, keeping sidebar and context-only actions out of the palette.

### Fixed

* Fixed Windows Server View structured snapshot output so services, processes, scheduled tasks, listeners, memory, and disk details keep their field delimiters and render correctly.
* Fixed Run Remote Command and Remote Search modals so the Use Sudo Mode option is hidden and ignored for Windows SSH/SFTP sessions.
* Fixed Windows SSH/SFTP PowerShell output handling so CLIXML progress records are suppressed in Run Remote Command, Log Viewer follow, Remote Search, and checksum output.
* Fixed Windows SSH/SFTP command execution to avoid wrapping already encoded PowerShell commands a second time.
* Fixed Sidebar command guards so unsupported session actions are rejected before prompting for Unix-only inputs.
* Fixed upload refresh synchronization between the Webview and Sidebar so the affected remote directory is refreshed after uploads complete.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-06-25

### Added

* Added connection groups for saved connections.
* Added new Server View overview cards for Sessions, Listeners, Swap, and IO Wait.

### Improved

* Improved several Webview and Server View UI and usability details.
* Improved Sidebar new connection creation so connection details are collected before saving instead of creating an incomplete draft profile.
* Improved Sidebar connection state visuals with an updated server icon and reused the draft icon to indicate saved connections with pending changes.
* Improved Webview directory loading, file list rendering, filtering, and row handling performance for slow or large directory listings.
* Improved FTP modified-date fallback so MDTM checks run selectively in the background without blocking folder navigation.
* Improved SSH/FTP connection error messages with shorter user-facing status messages and more detailed diagnostics in the Output log.

### Changed

* Enabled Server View auto-refresh by default with a subtle toolbar countdown.
* Removed the redundant Webview Open Connections header above connection tabs.
* Made Sidebar saved connection details read-only while the connection is active.

### Fixed

* Fixed Server View user crontab opening while Sudo Mode is enabled so it opens the selected user crontab instead of root's crontab.
* Fixed an intermittent issue where saving a connection profile could leave the UI stuck in a busy "Saving connection..." state even after the profile was saved.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-22

### Improved

* Improved the Webview Connection Profile dropdown with inline connect/disconnect actions for saved profiles.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added

* Added `remoteedit.webview.fileList.openOnNameClick` to control single-click opening from item names in the Webview file list.

### Improved

* Aligned Webview file opening with the Sidebar so editor tabs are created immediately while content loads through the remote file provider. Slow file loads now show cancellable progress, and failed Webview opens keep the detailed error dialog.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

* Added Server View for SSH/SFTP connections with overview, system information, services, processes, scheduled jobs, log shortcuts, port forwarding, and Quick Tasks.
